    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This low-carb spin on stuffed peppers is a decadent and rich casserole that everyone is sure to love. Cauliflower florets take the place of rice to keep it keto-friendly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 head cauliflower, broken into florets</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>Â½ cup onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place cauliflower in a food processor and pulse into grounds the size of rice grains. Transfer to a large casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Combine beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add green bell peppers and Italian seasoning; continue cooking until slightly tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain excess moisture from the beef mixture. Add tomatoes and beef broth. Simmer until flavors combine, about 5 minutes. Add mixture to the cauliflower in the casserole dish; mix to combine. Shake coconut aminos over the casserole; top evenly with Cheddar cheese.</li>
